# school-name-generator
Generates possible abbreviations of a Chinese school.

School Name Generator aims at helping distinguish different schools by calculating all possible common school names for a school.

This is originally designed for OIerDB (http://bytew.net/OIer), but this program can be
used for other purposes related to school names.

Due to the simplicity of the names of schools in North America, this generator does not support generation of English school names. *But support for English names may be added later on.*
